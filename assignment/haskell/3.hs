-- Represent each hand as a list of pair tuples. Name your function for finding the winning hand "w"nner‚Äù, and call it as follows:
-- hand1 = [(3, "H"), (10, "S"), (4, "S"), (4, "C"), (5, "C")]
-- hand2 = [(2, "H"), (2, "S"), (5, "S"), (2, "C"), (13, "C")]
-- winner hand1 hand2

-- Your winner function and all associated helper functions should be defined in a module called Poker, in a file Poker.hs. I should be able to load the Poker module into GHCi and call your winner function.
